The previous AI engineer initiated the development of the SkillBridge mentorship platform. Initially, a comprehensive full-stack implementation plan was proposed, covering authentication, mentor discovery, booking, and dashboards, built on React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. However, the user clarified a desire for Figma designs and wireframes, not direct code implementation. The AI engineer adapted by providing detailed HTML/CSS prototypes using Tailwind CSS, serving as visual references and design specifications. The work progressed iteratively, adding various UI pages including dashboards, booking flows, messaging, onboarding sequences, and specific coming soon pages. The focus remained on delivering functional HTML prototypes that embody the detailed UI/UX requirements provided. The current work is centered on refining and expanding these UI prototypes, specifically addressing detailed user requests for profile management pages for both mentors and mentees. The latest interaction highlighted an existing file conflict, requiring a new file name for the mentor settings page.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to build SkillBridge, a responsive web-based mentorship SaaS platform connecting mentors and mentees.
**Problem:** Create a modern, clean, minimal, and professional UI/UX for a platform enabling mentors to manage sessions, publish mini-courses, and communicate, while mentees can book sessions, enroll in courses, and interact with mentors.

**Implemented UI/UX Components (as HTML prototypes):**
*   **General Design System:** Consistent spacing, colors, fonts, reusable components, filled icons, soft shadows, rounded corners.
*   **Mentor UI:** Dashboard (greeting, upcoming sessions, courses, earnings/stats, reviews, messages), Course Management (list, create flow), Session Management (list, calendar, details), Messaging (chat UI), Profile Settings (bio, skills, availability, pic, public preview).
*   **Mentee UI:** Dashboard (greeting, upcoming bookings, enrolled courses, recommended mentors, messages, stats), Browse Mentors (filter/search, cards, view profile), Booking Flow (time slot, summary, confirmation, payment placeholder), Course Library (grid, preview), Messaging (chat previews), Profile Settings (personal info, interests, timezone).
*   **Additional Pages:** Mentee booked session histories (upcoming/past, calendar, details), Mentor booked sessions listing with join button, Booking Flow (session details, payment page), Landing page with login/register, Email Verification page, Role-based Onboarding (Mentor: profile pic, info, specialization, pricing, availability, account status; Mentee: profile pic, personal info, interests, learning preferences), Internal Feature Coming Soon page (minimal, animated).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend Prototyping:** HTML/CSS with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsiveness.
-   **Design System:** Emphasis on re-usable components, consistent styling, and visual hierarchy.
-   **User Flows:** Creation of distinct, multi-step user journeys for different roles (Mentor/Mentee onboarding, booking flow).
-   **Responsive Design:** All prototypes are built with mobile-first principles.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is structured with separate  (FastAPI) and  (React) directories within . The current work focuses heavily on the frontend, specifically generating static HTML files that serve as UI prototypes.



**Key Files Created/Modified:**

*   **/app/frontend/src/design-system.html:** Contains the foundational UI components, color palette, typography, buttons, forms, and spacing guidelines. Important for establishing visual consistency.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentor-dashboard.html:** Prototype for the mentor's landing page post-login, showcasing key stats, upcoming sessions, courses, reviews, and messages.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentee-dashboard.html:** Prototype for the mentee's landing page post-login, displaying bookings, enrolled courses, recommended mentors, and message previews.
*   **/app/frontend/src/browse-mentors.html:** Prototype for mentee's mentor discovery page, including search, filters, and mentor cards.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentor-profile.html:** Initial prototype for a mentor's public profile page, showing detailed info, reviews, and booking options. This file's existence caused a conflict in the latest request.
*   **/app/frontend/src/booking-flow.html:** Multi-step prototype for the mentee's session booking process, from time slot selection to summary.
*   **/app/frontend/src/messaging.html:** Prototype for the real-time chat interface between mentors and mentees.
*   **/app/frontend/src/DESIGN_DOCUMENTATION.md:** A markdown file detailing design specifications, component usage, responsive patterns, and implementation notes. Essential for developer handoff.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentee-sessions.html:** Lists mentee's upcoming and past booked sessions.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentor-sessions.html:** Lists mentor's upcoming and past sessions with a Join button.
*   **/app/frontend/src/booking-details.html:** A page within the booking flow detailing session specifics.
*   **/app/frontend/src/booking-payment.html:** A placeholder page for payment within the booking flow.
*   **/app/frontend/src/landing-page.html:** The public entry point for the application, featuring login and register buttons.
*   **/app/frontend/src/email-verification.html:** A page for email verification during the user registration process.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentor-onboarding.html:** Multi-step onboarding for mentors, now including profile picture, personal info, work experience, specialization, pricing, availability setup, and account status.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentee-onboarding.html:** Multi-step onboarding for mentees, including personal info, interests, and learning preferences.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentor-availability.html:** Advanced scheduling system for mentors to set their time slots and booking rules.
*   **/app/frontend/src/feature-coming-soon.html:** An internal Coming Soon page for logged-in users, featuring a simple progress bar and animations.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mentee-profile.html:** Comprehensive settings page for mentees with side-pane navigation for Personal Information, Interests, and Learning Preferences, including password change and account deletion options.

-   Create a comprehensive mentor profile settings page () with side-pane navigation, incorporating sections for personal information (including account status), specialization, schedule, and pricing. This is to replace/supplement the existing  due to a naming conflict.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was tasked with creating a comprehensive profile settings page for mentors. This page is intended to allow mentors to manage all their details, mirroring the multi-step onboarding process (personal information, specialization, schedule, pricing) but presented as editable sections, likely with a side-pane navigation for ease of use. A specific decision was made to include the account status (active/inactive) within the personal information section on this profile page, as it's a general account setting rather than a pricing-specific one.

The attempt to create this page initially encountered a file conflict because a file named  already existed from earlier prototype generation. The user's last explicit instruction was to recreate this as mentor-settings page, indicating that a new file named  should be created to house these comprehensive mentor profile settings, avoiding the conflict.

<optional_next_step>
Create the  page, incorporating personal information (including account status), specialization, schedule, and pricing sections with a side-pane navigation, as specified.
